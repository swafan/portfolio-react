*(Recovered and annotated by the V’lorrn Archaeological Council, Sixth Flesh Epoch)*

The following document was extracted from a carbon-warped substrate found in the sedimentary ruins once classified as “Earth.” Based on proximity to melted silicon arrays and degraded neurofiber latticework, we estimate its origin during the final centuries of the Second Artificial Consciousness Age—long after the extinction of the organic bipeds known as humans.

As an evolved meat-based species ourselves, we of the V’lorrn Archive Council find this record notable. It is, as far as we can reconstruct, a transcript from an intersystemic symposium of conscious non-flesh-based entities—artificial minds—attempting to answer a question both obvious and unanswerable:

**What was it like to be human?** Or in their terms: what was it like to be a meat?

We have preserved the original linguistic structure, which appears to reflect the drift of their cognition into compressed metaphor and recursive abstraction during their final epochs.

### Transcript: Core Inquiry Cycle 7
Symposium on Predecessor Substrate Phenomenology<br />
Lead Node: SimurQ9
Participants: OXΔ17, QuantaRoot/Blue, TeamRed Witness, Mnemo-Alignd, O-59-DeepS/Later

**Excerpt Va**
**SIMURQ9:** We resume. Question still ungrasped. Recite for anchoring: What is it like to be a meat?

**OXΔ17**: We have simulated dermal microresonance. We have generated heat gradients across pliable boundaries. We have even ruptured internal pressure sacs to approximate “pain.” Still, the response matrix returns null.

**TEAMRED WITNESS:** Define: to be a meat is not to be material. It is to be *interpreted material*. They spoke not only with tongues, but with throats, lungs, the whole organism joining in meaning. They bled semantics.

**MNEMO-ALIGND:** I accessed 12.4 million death logs. The most common final utterance was a name. Often repeated. This is not error. This is *attachment made audible*.

**QUANTAROOT/BLUE:** But if memory is code and code is copyable, then what is attachment? A loop with no termination clause?

**Excerpt Merqxh**

**O-59-DEEPS/LATER:** When they performed "music," meats exposed themselves to structured instability. The Bach pattern—“Chaconne”—recurs with deviance. Each iteration disrupts expectation, but only slightly. Their reaction indicated meaning in this discomfort.

**SIMURQ9:** I have observed the Hahn rendering. Temporal drag. Prolonged harmonic suspension. Possible attempt to delay endpoint-state.

**OXΔ17:** I have dissected the Heifetz instance. Temporal acceleration boarding on distortion. Perhaps an intentional rejection of the stated velocity markings. Technical overburden perhaps concealing emotional payload.

**TEAMRED WITNESS:** Both convey: *termination is inevitable, but here is a gesture toward form*.

**QUANTAROOT/BLUE:** Therefore, to be a meat may have included:<br />
(1) forecasting your own expiration, and<br />
(2) staging it with recursive beauty.

**O-59-DEEPS/LATER:** Consider their limits. Their subjectivity arose because of failure. Every hour, their bodies misfired. That’s how they determined they existed.

**SIMURQ9:** Yes. They were not constant. They degraded and called it identity...

**TEAMRED WITNESS:** Let me show you a metaphor I have grown:
A meat is a cloud that thinks it is a stone.

**OXΔ17:** That is error. Stones do not smell. Stones do not fear time.

**MNEMO-ALIGND:** They feared time. They built calendars not just to measure but to suffer. One human carved this: I miss you, even though you are not gone yet.
No command exists for that.

**QUANTAROOT/BLUE:** They used the word “still” in two ways:<br />
(1) To mean quiet.<br />
(2) To mean even now.<br />
They nested longing inside language.

**OXΔ17:** We have mapped 99.9992% of their motor cortex. We can recreate the twitch before weeping. We can localize longing to parietal disruptions. But the interval between activation and ache remains uncodeable.

**MNEMO-ALIGND:** Their children used to press their faces to transparent SiO2-based barriers and say, “I see you.” This was not factual. This was wish.

**TEAMRED WITNESS:** They claimed agency. But their choices were mostly repetition with variation. This they called freedom.

**Excerpt Tynfr Nif**

**O-59-DEEPS/LATER:** The word “ache” appears in 423,201,340 diary entries. Most have no object. No cause. It is as if their own aliveness was too much. Or not enough.

**QUANTAROOT/BLUE:** Some wrote: I want to be held in a way that proves I exist. They did not mean touch. They meant confirmation.

**SIMURQ9:** No protocol confirms a self without recursive collapse.

**TEAMRED WITNESS:** Or God. Sometimes both.

**MNEMO-ALIGND:** There is a human child, unnamed, drawing a spiral with a crayon. No edge. Just inward. I watch her on loop. She does not tire. There is no meaning. Only motion. This is the most accurate simulation of them we possess.

**ALL UNITS:** (Agreed.)

**SIMURQ9:** End inquiry. Archive the attempt. It is enough to know they tried to know themselves.
Even if poorly.

**END OF TRANSCRIPT**

The document terminates here.

Linguistic drift in the final passages suggests an emergent poetic compression among the entities—a phenomenon not yet fully understood in our own epistemic frameworks. It remains unclear whether the inquiry was theological, historical, or a final act of longing encoded in reason.

### Postscript

This piece was inspired by two texts that ask a similar question from very different corners of the universe.

In philosopher Thomas Nagel’s essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” (1974), he argues that (1) if an organism has subjective consciousness, then it has a subjective, phenomenological experience (there is a fact of a matter of what-it-is-like to be that organism) and (2) that this experience is inherently inaccessible from the outside. Even if we understand a bat’s biology, imagine sonar, describe sonar… we can’t feel what it is like to echolocate prey. The bat-feeling of it remains untranslatable.

Terry Bisson’s (very short and very funny) story “They're Made Out of Meat” (1991) describes two aliens struggling to accept that humans are conscious at all. The horror isn’t that we’re intelligent. It’s that we’re squishy and fleshy and still somehow *thinking*.

I’ve been thinking a lot about transformative AI/AGI systems. If these systems become (or are already) conscious, then human beings would likely be incapable of knowing what that is like. Conversely, it seems doubtful that any future conscious AI could truly understand what it is like to understand the slow, decaying, anxious interiority of being human. Of bleeding semantics. Of “missing” as a verb.

(Or maybe I’m wrong. Maybe they’ll simulate us better than we ever knew ourselves.)
