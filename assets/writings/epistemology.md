### 1: INTRODUCTION

This essay introduces Relevant Goals Contextualism (RGC), a variant of epistemic contextualism that builds on Edward Craig’s insights into the social functions of our knowledge-talk and emphasizes the centrality of goals in knowledge attribution. It begins by analyzing and modifying Craig’s hypothesis, positing that what we do when we say “*S* knows that *p*” is in part flagging *S* as a “good enough” informant about *p*. Through this reinterpretation, I demonstrate how the concept of “good enough” informants connects the quality of *S*’s information to the purposes it is good enough for and underscore the importance of goals in this structure.

After a brief overview of epistemic contextualism, the paper outlines the core tenets of RGC, which are extended from the insights about goals we derived from Craig. We then demonstrate how this focus on goals allows RGC to offer improved responses to two prominent challenges to contextualism: Duncan Pritchard’s problem of epistemic descent and Jason Stanley’s *Low Attributor-High Subject Stakes* bank cases.

Finally, I briefly compare RGC with a similar view, David Henderson’s Gate-Keeping Contextualism, to highlight RGC’s distinctive focus on goals in knowledge attributions and the benefits this provides.

### 2. CRAIG'S HYPOTHESIS

#### 2.1. Setup and Craig's Hypothesis

In *Knowledge and the State of Nature*, Craig (1990, 1-10) suggests a methodology for epistemological research. Instead of defining “knowledge” by directly looking for its necessary and sufficient conditions, he recommends working backward: start by analyzing what our utterances about “knowledge” and its cognates do for us in our social lives.

Knowledge-talk is ubiquitous. Phrases like “I know,” “she knows,” or “Do you know” serve crucial social functions. Observing this, Craig hypothesizes that our knowledge-talk is used to flag good sources of information (1990, 11). Put another way, when we say, “*S* knows whether *p*,” what we are doing is flagging *S* as a good source of information (or “informant”) about whether *p*. For example,

* *Positive attribution:* If I say to you, “Godwin knows whether *p*,” I am endorsing Godwin as a good informant about whether *p*. I am flagging, to you, Godwin’s high quality as an informant.
* *Negative attribution:* If I say to you, “Liam wouldn’t know *p*,” I am cautioning against relying on his information about *p*. I am flagging, to you, that he is not a good informant about *p*.

Craig’s hypothesis captures a key social aspect of what we do when we say things like “*S* knows that *p*” or “*S* doesn’t know that *p*.” It is a type of *flagging for others* that aligns with our everyday need for information to achieve our goals. While good information facilitates success, poor information can hinder it: and as such, differentiating good informants (knowers) from bad informants (ones who don’t know) is important to us.

However, it may be debatable whether flagging informants is the sole function of knowledge-talk. To account for possible nuances, let us begin with a refined hypothesis—*Craig’s Hypothesis**: when we say, “*S* knows whether *p*,” what we are doing is, at least in part, flagging *S* as a good informant about whether *p*.

#### 2.2. A Semi-Skeptical Worry About Craig

Differentiating good informants from bad ones is clearly critical in our daily lives. However, this differentiation reveals a troubling pattern: there are many ways to imagine better informants, which may raise doubts about the reliability of our knowledge attributions.

To illustrate, suppose we would like to find out whether all the students attended class on Wednesday. Consider the following informants.

1. Irene: Irene gets it right about whether all the students attended class on Wednesday by counting attendance. She has never gotten it wrong on Wednesdays but errs sometimes on Fridays (when she is busy thinking about the weekend).
2. Irene*: Irene* gets it right about whether all the students attended class regardless of the day by counting attendance. However, the classroom prankster Ginet has been placing a papier-mâché model of himself at his desk while hiding elsewhere in the classroom. Irene* has unknowingly been counting the model but not the real Ginet. So, while her final counts are correct, her accuracy is unintentional.[^1]
3. Irene**: Irene** gets it right regardless of the day by counting attendance and does not get deceived by elaborate pranks.

This iterative process of imagining increasingly capable informants (i.e., Irene*, Irene**) exposes a key question. Even if Irene is a good informant, we can imagine modifications to make her a better one—the reader can even attempt to imagine other demands we might want to place on Irene**, perhaps even imagining Irene*****, who is superior to all variants above. However, all of Irene, Irene*, Irene** seem capable enough for my inquiry about whether all students attended class on Wednesday. If knowledge is, in part, used to flag good informants, which one of these informants should we flag as “good”?

One interpretation is that knowledge is what lies “at the end of the road.” In this view, we revise Craig’s claim with a more stringent one: when we say, “S knows whether p,” we are flagging S as the best informant about whether p. However, neither Irene nor Irene* qualifies as the best informant since we were able to imagine Irene**—and if we can imagine a yet superior informant Irene***, then Irene** is not the best, either. This reasoning leads to a semi-skeptical conclusion:[^2] Since a superior informant can often be imagined, we seem to never quite have the best informant. Thus, our informant’s ordinary assertions like “all the students are in class on Wednesday” become false under this view. But of course, this is a problem—we want to know things to function in daily life.

Additionally, this goes against intuition. Clearly, it cannot be that we are wrong most of the time when we say, “*S* knows that *p*.” At some point, the ways we use “*S* knows that *p*” just is the way it is properly used![^3] That said, there is a better interpretation of Craig entirely.

<!-- Footnotes for section 2.2. -->
[^1]: This is a modified Gettier case (Gettier 1963). While we won’t directly address Gettier, we can simply rely on the intuition that Irene* was lucky to have gotten it right and we may prefer an Irene** who gets it right without getting lucky.
[^2]: I only say “semi-” skeptical as I am not claiming that assertions like “*S* knows trhat *p*" are *always* false. That said, it is tenable that this reading of Craig can lead to a “fully” skeptical conclusion. To argue for this will rely on arguing for the idea that there *just isn't* a “best informant,” and that this figure is purely theoretical.
[^3]: One defense the semi-skeptic might give is this. Knowledge, properly speaking, is what lies at the end of the road (for clarity, let’s call knowledge, properly speaking, “knawledge”). It is true that we don’t knaw a whole lot. However, when we say, “*S* knows that *p*,” we are not saying that “*S* knaws that *p*. Instead, we are speaking loosely. In effect, we are saying something like “*S*'s belief that *p* approximates knawledge." The utterance “*S* knows that *p*” is still, strictly speaking, true, but insofar as “knows” means something like “approximates knawing.” This is not *exactly* Peter Unger's (1975, 83) view, but was inspired by Unger's account.

#### 2.3. The “Good Enough” Informant

I ask the nurse, “Is Dr. Granger in the hospital today? I was hoping to thank her for helping with my dad’s recovery.” “Yes, she is. In fact, I just spoke with her. I will get her if you can wait 10 minutes.”

In most ordinary contexts, we would consider the nurse a good informant about whether Dr. Granger is in the hospital. Having just spoken to her, the nurse possesses strong evidence of the doctor’s whereabouts. But is the nurse the *best* informant? No. For example, I can suggest a Gettier-like scenario where a cabal of secret, evil doppelgängers have infiltrated the hospital. Suppose both the real and the fake doctor are present, and the nurse encounters the imposter. In this case, if she fails to distinguish the genuine doctor from the imposter, her statement about Dr. Granger being in the hospital would be true, but her accuracy would be unintentional. Therefore, the nurse cannot be the best informant about whether the doctor was in, as we can imagine someone better—namely, an informant who can differentiate between the genuine doctor and the imposter. Under a “best informant” reading of Craig, the fact that we can imagine a better informant than the nurse means we cannot say “the nurse knows.”

However, let’s set aside peculiar epistemology examples involving doppelgängers and fake doctors and simply focus on the everyday context. In practical, everyday terms, is the nurse a good informant about whether Dr. Granger is in the hospital? Yes! In our normal contexts, the nurse is a suitable informant for my inquiry. I would be comfortable relying on the nurse as an informant about whether Dr. Granger is in the hospital. Indeed, suppose my dad arrives later and asks me whether Dr. Granger is in, so that he can thank her personally, I might confidently reply, “Yes, I know she’s here. I’ve spoken to the nurse about it.” The nurse’s testimony is strong enough for me to claim knowledge myself. In everyday situations, informants simply need to be “good enough.” Even if the nurse is not the “best” informant, they are “good enough” for my practical purposes.

What does good-enough-ness look like? Clearly, being “good enough” is contextual. The nurse is good enough for our everyday contexts but not so in ones involving fake doctors. But here lies a subtle yet important second point: the context we use to determine whether something (or someone) is “good enough” depends on *purpose*—what it is being used for. A second-hand car may not be good enough for Formula 1 racing but suffices for my commute to work. Similarly, my cooking skills are not good enough for *MasterChef* but good enough to impress my partner on date night. My Spanish is not good enough to allow me to read *Don Quixote* in its original language but suffices for basic conversation.

In each case, being “good enough” depends on achieving a specific goal, *G*—whether it’s commuting, impressing a partner, or holding a conversation. A beat-up car is not good enough if *G* is winning the Grand Prix but is good enough if *G* is simply getting to work.

Returning to the nurse: in an ordinary context where my goal is to thank Dr. Granger, the nurse is good enough; if my goals shift to something like identifying imposters, the nurse will no longer suffice.

Building on this, I propose a modification to Craig that crystalizes the insights we gained from the nurse—*Craig’s Hypothesis***: when we say, “*S* knows that *p*,” what we are doing is, at least in part, flagging *S* as a *good enough* informant about whether *p* *for the relevant and salient goals to us*. This modified version aligns better with our everyday use of the term “knows” than the semi-skeptical interpretation of Craig. In an everyday scenario, if I were simply trying to locate Dr. Granger to thank her in person, I might be very willing to attribute the nurse with knowing whether Dr. Granger is in, flagging her as a good enough source of information. On the other hand, if my goals involved differentiating fake doctors from real ones, I might say that Dr. Granger doesn’t know, denying her as being good enough to inform us whether Dr. Granger is around.

Summarizing the above, by extending Craigian observations about the social nature of knowledge-talk, we have arrived at *Craig’s Hypothesis*** and drawn a relationship between our goals and how we use “knows” and its cognates. This is the ingredient needed to develop Relevant Goals Contextualism (RGC). But before diving into RGC, please find below some brief remarks about epistemic contextualism and some existing “traditional” versions.

### 3. RELEVANT GOALS CONTEXTUALISM

#### 3.1. Epistemic Contextualism, In General

Suppose a subject *S* believes a proposition *p*, and *p* is in fact true. Suppose then a knowledge attributor *A* comes along and says, “*S* knows that *p*.” Has *A* uttered a true statement? Epistemic contextualism is a group of views that hold that the verity of *A*’s utterance depends in various ways on *A*’s context (DeRose 1995, 1999; Rysiew, 2023;).[^4]

As a heuristic, consider the word “cold.” We might say that 10°C (50°F) is cold in LA but not Alaska. Whether we deem 10°C “cold” depends on the context. Contextualists argue that “*S* knows that *p*” functions similarly: whether *A*’s attribution that “*S* knows that *p*” is true depends in part on the relevant context. Stanley (2005, 3-4) provides an illustrative example:[^5]

*Low Stakes*. It is Friday afternoon when Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving home. They had planned to stop at the bank to deposit their paychecks, but it is not particularly urgent since no bills are due. When they arrive, they see a long line. Hannah says, “I know that the bank will be open tomorrow morning as I was just there last Saturday.”

*High Stakes*. It is Friday afternoon, and Hannah and Sarah are in a similar situation. However, this time, it is imperative that they deposit their paychecks before Monday because their rent payment is due and eviction is at risk. When they see a long line, Hannah initially says, “I know the bank will be open tomorrow; I was just there last Saturday.” However, after Sarah points out that banks sometimes change their hours, Hannah reconsiders and says, “I guess you’re right. I don’t know that the bank will be open tomorrow.”

Intuition tells us that we would likely agree with Hannah’s assessment here: In *Low Stakes*, she is correct in saying “I know the bank is open”; in *High Stakes*, she is correct in saying “I don’t know.” Contextualism explains by appealing to the context. In *Low Stakes*, Hannah acts as the subject *S* but also the attributor *A* (as she is self-attributing herself knowledge). Contextualism posits that the prevailing context in *Low Stakes* demands lower standards for Hannah to attribute herself knowledge. As such, it was true when she uttered” I know.” Similarly, in *High Stakes*, Hannah acts as both subject and attributor. However, in this case, the context demands higher epistemic standards. So despite Hannah being in the same epistemic position with regard to whether the bank is open tomorrow, her epistemic position is now no longer strong enough for her to say that she knows the bank is open. It is true when Hannah asserts that she doesn’t know.

This diagnosis is shared by most contextualist views. However, there are minute differences between different versions. For example, some “traditional” contextualist views:[^6]

* DeRose (2009, 128-152): For DeRose, standard changes occur over the course of *A*’s conversation. These “conversational contexts” that determine the relevant epistemic standards evolve over the course of conversation. For example, once Sarah brings up that banks sometimes change their hours and that is it important to deposit the paycheck, the context changes.
* Lewis (1996, 559): For Lewis, whether *A*’s assertion that “*S* knows that *p*” is true depends on certain rules including the *rule of attention*, which says that any alternatives where not-*p* would be true that *A* is currently paying attention to must be considered as part of *A*’s context. As such, if Hannah is paying attention to the possibility that banks may change hours tomorrow, perhaps after Sarah mentions it, the context demands higher epistemic standards for her utterance that “I know that the bank is open” to be true.
* Blome-Tillmann (2009, 244-9): This view modifies Lewis’ by replacing the *rule of attention* with pragmatic presupposition. This means that any alternatives where not-*p* that other (potential) conversational participants would treat as a shared assumption must be considered as part of *A*’s context.

#### 3.2. Relevant Goals Contextualism

I propose Relevant Goals Contextualism (RGC), a form of contextualism that differs from existing veins of contextualism by (1) building on *Craig’s Hypothesis*** and (2) emphasizing that whether something is “good enough” depends on its ability to achieve specific goals. It says that proper knowledge attribution depends on a quadripartite relationship between a subject *S*, a proposition *p*, a knowledge attributor *A*, and a set of goals *G<sub>A</sub>* = {*g<sub>1</sub>*, *g<sub>2</sub>*, …, *g<sub>n</sub>*}, where each element *g* in *G<sub>A</sub>* refers to a relevant and salient goal to the knowledge attributor. For RGC, whether “*S* knows that *p*” is true as uttered by *A* when *S* has a true belief that *p* depends on whether that belief is “good enough” for *A* to flag it as such in the lights of *g* in *G<sub>A</sub>*. To illustrate, consider:

*High Attributor-Low Subject Stakes*. It is Friday afternoon when Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving home. It is imperative they deposit their paychecks as their rent is due and eviction is at risk. Seeking confirmation about the bank’s hours, Hannah calls her friend Billy to check. Billy says, “I know the bank will be open tomorrow; I was there last Saturday.” After Hannah and Sarah discuss the fact that banks sometimes change their hours, Hannah says, “Billy doesn’t really know that the bank will be open.” (Stanley, 2005, 5).

Regardless of what Billy thinks, our intuitive judgment when considering Hannah’s utterance is that her statement “Billy doesn’t really know” is true. For RGC, we explain this by appealing to the salient and relevant goals for the attributor Hannah—like avoiding eviction. These high-standards goals raise the epistemic standards required for Hannah to attribute knowledge to Billy. Hannah’s utterance that “Billy doesn’t really know” is true.

But how does it work when the knowledge attributor and the subject are the same—such as in our ordinary knowledge claims like, “I know that *p*”? Consider once again *Low Stakes* and *High Stakes* bank cases. In *Low Stakes*, the relevant and salient goals for Hannah (such as avoiding stopping by the bank tomorrow to deposit their paycheck instead of driving a bit more after work on Monday) do not require high standards. As such, Hannah’s information that the bank is open tomorrow as she was there last weekend is good enough for Hannah to attribute herself knowledge. But in *High Stakes*, Hannah, acting as the knowledge attributor, does not attribute herself with knowledge as the relevant and salient goals involve avoiding eviction. Her information that the bank is open is not “good enough” to satisfy the standards as set by this high-standards set of goals.

#### 3.3. Whose Goals Matter? On Goals and “Flagging”

An important point of elaboration is *G<sub>A</sub>*, the set of relevant and salient goals to *A* that determines the context for *A*’s utterance “*S* knows that *p*.” When defining *G<sub>A</sub>*, we did not stipulate whose goals these include. GA encompasses the goals that are relevant and salient in the context of *A*’s knowledge attribution. *G<sub>A</sub>* often includes *A*’s personal interests—but *A*’s personal interests need not exhaust all the relevant and salient goals that GA encompasses. Instead, these goals are not inherently fixed to any specific party: they are simply the goals that are relevant and salient for *A*.

Recall Craig’s observation about the purpose of knowledge-talk in everyday social life. There is inherently a social aspect baked in here. Likewise, there is implicitly a social aspect when we reference *Craig’s Hypothesis***.

Our modified hypothesis tells us that when we say, “*S* knows that *p*,” what we are doing is, at least in part, flagging *S* as a good enough informant about whether *p* for the relevant and salient goals to us. To illustrate, consider other examples of “flagging” in social life. Flagging a leak in an apartment building signals tenants or management; flagging an email as important signals colleagues or a manager. Similarly, attributing knowledge often involves signaling *S*’s quality as an informant *to others*.

When I say to you, “*S* knows that *p*,” I’m letting you know that S is a good informant that p. This is inherently social: it is a signaling *to others*. But if this is, at least in part, what we do when we engage in knowledge-talk, then the goals and considerations of the audience of this “flagging” matter. To “properly” flag, A must account for the relevant and salient goals of those relying on the flagged information. The context of *A*’s statement “*S* knows that *p*” is inevitably linked to the goals and considerations of who *A* is speaking to.

Suppose Susan informs me that she is heading to the school fair and plans to stay for an hour. 45 minutes later, when my friend asks if Susan is at the fair, I reply, “Yes, she is at the fair,” based on Susan’s earlier statement. However, when police officers approach me with the same question and tell me that she is a suspect in a violent crime, I adjust and temper my response: “I’m not sure—I wasn’t at the fair myself. Susan mentioned she was heading there but might have left. She could also have been lying.”

When I flag Susan’s whereabouts to the police, I exercise greater precision and caution than when I flag the information to a friend. The goals (like finding the culprit) of my audience influence the standards I apply when flagging information. Put another way, the audience’s considerations, when relevant, shape proper flagging. To further illustrate:

*High Audience-Low Subject & Attributor Stakes*. It is Friday afternoon when Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving home. It is imperative they deposit their paychecks before Monday to avoid eviction. Seeking confirmation about bank hours, Hannah calls her friend Subat to confirm. Though Subat was only planning to go tomorrow for fun, after being told about Hannah and Sarah’s situation, he says, “I don’t know whether the bank will be open tomorrow. Banks sometimes change hours.”

In this example, Subat, acting as the attributor, is flagging whether he is a good enough informant to Hannah and Sarah. Their high-standards goals of avoiding eviction are therefore relevant and salient to Subat. Subat should not therefore self-attribute himself knowledge that the bank is open tomorrow.

### 4. CHALLENGES FOR CONTEXTUALISM

RGC links contextualist frameworks to a modified Craigian hypothesis about good enough informants while emphasizing the centrality of goals in knowledge attribution. To demonstrate how this helps us, I will now describe two challenges for contextualism and show how RGC offers improved responses versus “traditional” views.

#### 4.1. Epistemic Descent

Duncan Pritchard (2001, 327-49) identifies an asymmetry between “epistemic ascent” and “epistemic descent” within contextualism where ascent refers to contextual shifts that raise epistemic standards for knowledge attribution and descent refers to the lowering of epistemic standards. Consider the examples below.

*Low-A*. Flynn and Flannery discuss whether their flight has a stopover in Chicago. Olive overhears this and says, “There is a stopover. I have just checked the flight itinerary.” Flynn then asserts, “Olive knows that there is a stopover.”

*High-A*. After the events of *Low-A*, Flannery emphasizes that it is critical they make the stopover and raises the possibility that flight itineraries may contain misprints. Flynn says, “You’re right, Olive doesn’t know that the flight has a stopover.”

*Low-2-A*. Later after the events of *High-A*, the conversational context has “lowered” once again for Flynn—perhaps he realizes it is not, in fact, important that they make the stopover in Chicago and was not thinking about possible misprints. Can Flynn now assert, “Olive knows that the flight has a stopover”?

“Traditional” veins of contextualism explain *Low-A* and *High-A* well. In *Low-A*, Flynn is in a low-standards context: since the standards are low, “Olive knows” is true. In *High-A*, standards rise and epistemic ascent occurs, making “Olive doesn’t know” appropriate. However, *Low-2-A* presents a problem: whether Flynn can reassert “Olive knows” creates issues for contextualism, regardless of the answer. Let’s consider both options one by one.

<ins>Option 1: Flynn can re-attribute knowledge</ins>

This option is probably what most contextualists would want to say. As a theory, contextualism aims to explain how and when statements like “*S* knows that *p*” are true—and if Flynn faces low epistemic standards in *Low-2-A*, he should be able to say “Olive knows.”

However, imagine Flynn now says “Olive knows that the flight has a stopover” in *Low-2-A*. We may have a strong intuition that his behavior is almost incoherent. It feels wrong for Flynn to first say “Olive knows” in *Low-A*, then “Olive doesn’t know” in *High-A*, and “Olive knows” once again in *Low-2-A*. Pritchard says this is because there is a mess of conversational implicatures. When Flynn first says “Olive knows” in *Low-A*, among other things, he conversationally implies that Olive is an authority on whether the flight has a stopover; when he says “Olive doesn’t know” in *High-A*, he reverses this implicature, implying that Olive is not an authority; when he once again says “Olive knows” in *Low-2-A*, he reverses his implicatures once again, implying that Olive is an authority after all. This leads us to think his behavior is bizarre.

So, if the contextualist says that Flynn can reassert “Olive knows,” then they would have to accept that contextualism can lead to a mess of conversational implicatures. This is, of course, an unattractive consequence: we certainly don’t want to have any such conversational messes in our epistemic theory.

<ins>Option 2: Flynn cannot re-attribute knowledge</ins>

Since option (1) is unattractive, the contextualist may perhaps instead argue that Flynn cannot say “Olive knows” in *Low-2-A*. Unfortunately, this option is worse.

Notice that if Flynn cannot say “Olive knows,” then epistemic descent does not occur. Even though the epistemic standards rise from *Low-A* to *High-A*, they do not fall back down in *Low-2-A*. The standards that govern whether Flynn can say “Olive knows” or not are now stuck being high after *High-A*. Once those standards rise, they stay risen (Pritchard 2001, 17; McKenna 2001, 747-750).

This would be very problematic for contextualism. Contextualism, as a theory, says there are high-standards contexts and low-standards contexts and aims to explain how “*S* knows that *p*” functions differently depending on which types of contexts we are in. However, this option suggests there is rarely such flexibility. Instead, there is a sort of high-standards epistemic permanence: once the standards go up, they stay up.

As such, “traditional” contextualists would likely have to argue for option (1). Certainly, this lessens the damage, but as we demonstrated, still leads to the unappealing consequence that contextualism can lead to a mess of conversational implicatures.

<ins>RGC's Partial Solution</ins>

RGC saves contextualism from Pritchard’s concerns by pointing out that we must consider goals as part of the epistemic context. This allows us to take up option (1) without the consequence of messy conversational implicatures. Consider the following analogy.

Street racer Fujiwara is speaking to a friend. His friend, noticing how old Fujiwara’s car is, asks whether the car will be fine for the race, to which Fujiwara responds, “It’s good enough.” However, after the friend mentions that a rival has upgraded their engine, Fujiwara says, “It’s not quite good enough yet” and decides to tune up his car. Later in the conversation, Fujiwara surprises his friend by informing him that the vehicle is the same one he uses to deliver tofu in his day job. After seeing his friend’s surprised face, Fujiwara pats the hood of his vehicle and says, “It’s good enough” with a smile.

I would think that we don’t have the same intuition that Fujiwara’s behavior is bizarre. But has Fujiwara not conversationally implied that the car is good enough, before retracting that implicature, then finally re-implying that the car is good enough after all? Recall that whether something is good enough depends on what is being used *for*. As such, it seems more exact that what Fujiwara has done is first imply that the car is good enough for street racing, then imply that it isn’t good enough to beat a competitor with an upgraded engine, then imply that is good enough for both racing and delivering tofu.

Similarly, RGC emphasizes that whether *A*’s utterance “*S* knows that *p*” is true in part depends on whether *S* is a good enough informant for *A* to flag her as such in the lights of *G<sub>A</sub>*. This clarifies that Flynn’s statements do not generate inconsistent conversational implicatures. Instead, they reflect changing goals and are not a blanket claim about whether Olive is an authority on whether the flight has a stopover. When Flynn says “Olive knows” in *Low-A*, what he is doing is flagging Olive as a good enough informant for the set of relevant and salient goals he is considering—call this set *G<sub>A-Low-1</sub>*. In *High-A*, the goals have changed. When he says “Olive doesn’t know,” he is flagging that Olive is not good enough for a new, heightened set of goals *G<sub>A-High</sub>*. In *Low-2-A*, *G<sub>A-High</sub>* is no longer relevant and salient to Flynn: he is just flagging that Olive is good enough for another lowered set of goals *G<sub>A-Low-2</sub>*. Understood this way, RGC allows us to explain the mechanics of descent in Pritchard’s example.

However, RGC only offers a “partial” solution. Consider a variant of Pritchard’s example, where the subject *S* and the attributor *A* are the same.

*Low-B*. Flynn and Flannery are discussing whether there is a stopover. Olive overhears and says, “I know that there is a stopover. I have just checked the flight itinerary.”

*High-B*. After the events of *Low-B*, Flynn informs Olive that it is very important that they make the stopover and raises the possibility that flight itineraries sometimes contain misprints. Olive then says, “You’re right. I don’t know whether there is a stopover.”

*Low-2-B*. After the events of *High-B*, Olive returns to her own group, where another friend in a low-stakes context coincidentally asks whether there is a stopover in Chicago.

Olive acts as both the subject and attributor in the *B*-cases. This proves trickier for RGC. Consider exactly what we say in *Low-2-B*. RGC says that Olive can say “I know that there is a stopover” as what the statement “I know that there is a stopover” now does is flag herself as a good enough informant for her friend’s low-standards context. The relevant and salient goals *G<sub>A</sub>* are her friend’s. As such, epistemic descent occurs. However, this explanation reveals an outstanding ambiguity: what is it that makes Flynn’s goals no longer relevant and salient for Olive? How do we establish which goals are relevant and salient? This suggests more refinement for RGC is still needed.

That said, even in this modified variant, RGC offers an improved response versus the “traditional” views. For example, in versions defended by Lewis and Blome-Tillmann, the possibility that flight itineraries may change is still a relevant alternative for Olive—and as such, Olive cannot reclaim knowledge. But this is essentially taking up option (2). The attributor (Olive) cannot re-attribute the subject (herself) knowledge. But there is no descent! Meanwhile, for DeRose, it’s unclear what would be said. DeRose (1995, 42), when speaking about epistemic descent, offers that epistemic descent occurs once “the conversational air has cleared.” But it’s quite unclear whether the conversational air has cleared—and if not, an account of how epistemic descent occurs at a later timeframe is still needed.

#### 4.2. Against Subject-Sensitive Invariantism & Stanley’s Bank Cases

Another challenge comes from Stanley’s (2005) expanded bank cases, which are often used to motivate taking up subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI), an alternative to contextualism. SSI’s central tenet is that knowledge attribution depends on the practical stakes of the *subject S* (the presumed “knower”). This is compared to contextualism, which posits that the truth condition of “*S* knows that *p*” depends on the context of the attributor A (the speaker of the sentence “*S* knows that *p*”). As Hannon pithily explains, the debate between contextualism and SSI “isn’t over whether practical interests play a role in determining whether a subject ‘knows’, but rather over whose practical interests play this role” (2013, 13).

We have already familiarized ourselves with some of the bank cases and shown how contextualism can explain these examples. However, consider the below variant.

*Low Attributor-High Subject Stakes*. It is Friday afternoon when Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving home. It is imperative they deposit their paychecks before Monday. After Sarah notes that banks sometimes change their hours, Hannah replies, “I guess you’re right. I don’t know that the bank will be open tomorrow.” Separately, Joe saw Hannah at the bank last Saturday. Joe doesn’t have any impending bills but is considering going to the bank tomorrow just for fun. Unaware of Hannah and Sarah’s predicament, Joe remarks, “Hannah knows that the bank will be open tomorrow. She was at the bank last Saturday.”

We might have the intuition that Hannah’s high-stakes situation makes it so that Joe’s assertion that “Hannah knows” is incorrect. However, if contextualism holds that the truth-conditions of knowledge attribution depend on Joe’s (the attributor’s) low-standards context, then would Joe’s low-standards context not make it so that his assertion is true? Instead, proponents of SSI would like to argue that it is Hannah’s (the subject’s) high personal stakes that determine the standards for knowledge attribution—and since they are high-stakes standards, Joe’s utterance is therefore improper.

There is an assumption at play in this objection. Stanley assumes that the attributor’s context cannot be influenced by the subject’s stakes. However, notice the objection would not work if this assumption were false: if Joe’s (the attributor’s) context can be influenced by Hannah’s (the subject’s) personal stakes, then the contextualist can claim that Joe’s assertion that “Hannah knows” was improper as he did not properly assess Hannah’s high standards.

Like many others have argued (DeRose, 2009, 226-277, Hannon, 2013, 13; Greco, 2008, 424-5), I see no reason to make this assumption. Specifically, though, RGC intuitively argues this by appealing to the concept of “goals” and “flagging.”

Earlier, we noted that flagging informants is always flagging informants to others. If it is true that knowledge attribution involves flagging S to others, it would make sense that the goals of these others be considered as well. It is not only the attributor’s goals that matter—instead, the determinant of context is dynamic. This, as previously demonstrated, allowed us to address examples like *High Audience-Low Subject & Attributor Stakes*.

Meanwhile, if knowledge attribution does involve a “flagging” to others, it seems unclear why proponents of SSI should think that a subject’s stakes alone should be so privileged as to call all the shots. Recall the *High Attributor-Low Subject Stakes* case from Section 4—Hannah and Sarah are in a high-stakes scenario and ask Billy (in a low-stakes situation) whether the bank is open, ultimately deciding he doesn’t. This was easy for the contextualist: since Hannah, as the attributor, is in a high-standards context, her utterance “Billy doesn’t know” is true. However, if SSI strictly holds that the determinant of context is the subject’s practical stakes alone, SSI would have to conclude that Billy does know that the bank is open, given his low subject-stakes, contradicting intuition.

### 5. FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

#### 5.1. RGC vs. Gate-Keeping Contextualism

RGC improves upon “traditional” veins of contextualism by integrating Craigian observations about the social nature of knowledge-talk into the framework, allowing more effective responses to objections raised by Pritchard and Stanely. However, RGC is not alone in connecting contextualism to the social dimensions of knowledge attribution. While a full analysis of how RGC compares to these “social” contextualist theories is beyond the scope of this paper, I will RGC’s unique focus on goals by briefly comparing it to one of the prominent “social” theories: David Henderson’s (2008, 2011) Gate-Keeping Contextualism.[^7]

<ins>Gate-Keeping Contextualism</ins>

Henderson’s Gate-Keeping Contextualism suggests that knowledge attribution involves “certifying sources, or withholding certification, and thereby keeping epistemic gate for a community” (2008, 125). He categorizes epistemic communities into two types:

1. *Applied practical communities*: These communities engage in specific practical endeavors, where knowledge attribution certifies that an informant meets the standards of these tasks. Put another way, “*S* knows that *p*” certifies *S* as an informant who is up to the standards of the tasks that the community is engaged in.
2. *General-purpose source communities*: These communities have indeterminate membership, encompassing present and future groups that may draw on the informant’s results. “*S* knows that *p*” certifies *S* such that community members may freely draw on *S*’s conclusion that *p*.

For example, in *High Stakes*, Hannah and Sarah form an *applied practical community*, where their community is engaged in high-stakes practical endeavors like avoiding eviction. This endeavor demands high epistemic standards for proper knowledge attribution, making Hannah’s utterance “I don’t know” true. Meanwhile, where there isn’t ostensibly a practical shared endeavor, Henderson appeals to *general-purpose source communities*: “*S* knows whether *p*” flags the quality of *S*’s information to a more generalized audience who should be able to draw upon this information.

However, Henderson’s taxonomy faces an issue, which is mitigated by RGC’s focus on goals. Consider a group of people who are in multiple applied practical communities. For instance, Phil, a philosopher, is currently having drinks with his colleagues at a pub. Throughout the conversation, Phil alternates between philosophical discussion and everyday topics. He says “I don’t know that *p*” when speaking about certain philosophical subjects, but says “I know that *p*” about certain everyday claims.

For Gate-Keeping Contextualism, it is the community that whether Phil’s assertions of “I know” and “I don’t know” are proper. However, should we understand Phil and his colleagues as part of a philosopher community or a community of friends talking at a pub? Clearly, these communities have very different epistemic standards.

Phil certainly exists in both communities simultaneously. However, this creates complexity. Let’s notate Phil’s philosophical statements as *PS*<sub>1</sub>, *PS*<sub>2</sub>, … *PS<sub>n</sub>* and his everyday claims *CS*<sub>1</sub>, *CS*<sub>2</sub>, … *CS<sub>n</sub>*. *PS* statements seem governed by the philosopher community, while *CS* statements are assessed by the friends-at-a-pub community. Now, under Gate-Keeping Contextualism, when we explain his knowledge claims (and denials) that occurred throughout the conversation, we need to appeal to the appropriate community whose standards determine whether or not Phil’s “I know” or “I don’t know” is appropriate. As such, if Phil alternates between claiming not to know *PS*<sub>1</sub> before claiming to know *CS*<sub>1</sub>, then claiming not to know *PS*<sub>2</sub>, and so forth, we must repeatedly switch between these communities, oscillating between the philosopher community and the friends-at-a-pub community.

While this isn’t a knock-down argument against Henderson, it seems that in shifty dynamic situations like Phil’s pub example, Gate-Keeping Contextualism’s explanation seems overcomplicated. Additionally, the explanation is quite unintuitive. This just isn’t how we intuitively understand what is occurring over the course of Phil’s conversation. It isn’t the case that Phil’s different statements are really addressing different communities: he is addressing the very same people!

On the other hand, RGC simplifies the explanation by focusing on the relevant and salient goals. When Phil says “I know” when referring to common everyday claims, he is flagging himself as good enough for a certain set of lower standards goals. Meanwhile, when Phil says “I don’t know” when talking about philosophical subjects, he is flagging himself as not good enough for what he presumes to be his colleagues’ goals of philosophical inquiry.

#### 5.2. Conclusion

We began with an investigation of Craigian insights about the social nature of our knowledge-talk. Ultimately, we noted that if “*S* knows that *p*” in part flags *S* as a good enough informant, we must ask: “Good enough for *what*?” This critical question, extended from Craig, forms the foundation of Relevant Goals Contextualism (RGC) and its integration of goals into epistemic contextualism.

By centering on goals, RGC provides a novel framework for understanding knowledge attributions. It provides compelling responses to challenges like Pritchard’s epistemic descent and Stanley’s *Low Attributor-High Subject Stakes*.

However, RGC is not without its own challenges. Ambiguities persist regarding the concept of “relevant and salient goals.” How should we determine which goals matter? Resolving these questions will be vital for RGC further.

Ultimately, RGC presents a promising way to refine epistemic contextualism. By anchoring knowledge attributions in goals, it deepens our understanding of our everyday knowledge-talk and effectively addresses key challenges.
