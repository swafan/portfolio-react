### One: Some Summers Don't Sound the Same

Nostalgia sounds like cicadas.

I picture myself hunched over my old Nintendo DS, the bootleg cartridge of *Pokémon Diamond* jammed slightly askew, buzzing in a way the official ones never did. Outside: the sound of summer, that insect rhythm—buzz, pause, buzz. You don’t really hear cicadas. They just exist around you, like static. Or memory.

It’s strange how that sound has become almost a universal shorthand. A kind of acoustic nostalgia. Even people who didn’t grow up near cicadas seem to know what it means.

A sound you never quite listened for, but always remember.

I don’t think I’ve heard them this summer.

Instead, I’ve been looking at the skyscraper that went up last year. Chrome. Curved edges. Almost… *bodily*. It doesn’t look natural, exactly, but it doesn’t look unnatural either. And I wonder if that’s the point. We want our creations to look like they were grown, not built. Like we’re borrowing from nature, not altering it. Like nature is still in charge.

But what is nature, really? And why do we keep invoking it like a parent whose permission we need?

I think about how often “natural” is used to sell us things: stomach meds, protein powder, water bottles, pesticides, herbicides, oat milk. We label products “all natural” as if kale chips emerge from the earth in vacuum-sealed bags. We call things “natural talent,” as if excellence weren’t shaped by scaffolding and contingency and access. Even in tech, we call it “natural language processing”—but what’s natural about language? Grammar was invented. Syntax was agreed upon. Semicolons didn’t exist before us.

And then there’s “unnatural.” A word people reach for when they want something to stop. A man in eyeliner. A woman who won’t have children. A child who doesn’t speak the “right” way. It’s not quite fear, but closure. It says: *this is not how things were meant to be*.

But meant by whom? In what version of the world?

### Two: Drawing the Line

“Man versus nature.”

It’s one of the basic types of conflict we’re taught in English class. Right up there with man versus man, and man versus self. I remember learning it in seventh grade. The examples were always dramatic—*Moby-Dick*. *Cast Away*. *Into the Wild*. A lone figure in the wilderness. Tooth against tooth.

But the phrase never quite sat right with me. Even then I wondered: why “man” and not “human”? And why is “nature” everything else? The bear is nature. The storm is nature. Even the man’s hunger is nature. But the man himself? Somehow not.

I suppose “man” is supposed to mean “human.” But like most substitutions, it hides more than it clarifies. It installs a hierarchy before the sentence even begins. “Man versus nature.” As if he weren’t part of it. As if the opposition were obvious.

We talk about nature like it’s a place outside of us. A terrain to be braved, or conquered, or photographed. The word does a kind of distancing. It says: this thing, out there, is not me. Even when it grows inside us. Even when it breathes for us.

Later, I learned that “man versus nature” wasn’t just a literary device. It was a worldview. Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, helped popularized both that phrase and the concept of “nature versus nurture.” He didn’t see nature as a home you lived in. He saw it as a hierarchy you sorted.

Galton believed intelligence could be bred. That morality could be ranked. That the human race could be optimized. “Nature,” to him, wasn’t a landscape—it was a logic. A justification. And “man”—as always—was the one doing the justifying.

But maybe Galton had it backwards. Maybe “man” isn’t above nature. Maybe he’s just its most recursive expression. Maybe our violence, our waste, our machines, our skyscrapers—these aren’t a break from nature. They’re its deepening.

We like to think of nature as balance. As harmony. But viruses are natural. Wildfires are natural. So is grief. So is extinction.

### Three: The Word We Use When We’re Afraid

When people say something is “unnatural,” they rarely mean it hasn’t happened before. They mean it shouldn’t. That it violates some invisible script. That it feels wrong, even if they can’t say why.

But even that logic doesn’t hold. Because if you’re looking for precedent, there’s no shortage. Gender variance has existed across cultures for centuries—from the Hijra in South Asia to the two-spirit identities in many Indigenous North Americans traditions. Homosexual behavior has been observed in over 1,500 animal species. History remembers more than we like to admit.

And yet, even when we know these things, the word persists. “Unnatural.” It’s not about what was, but what feels like it *should* be. It doesn’t ask for proof. It just points to discomfort. And then moralizes it.

But let’s say—just for a moment—there were no examples. That none of this had ever happened before. That history were silent. Would the logic change?

Because the real error isn’t factual. It’s philosophical. We confuse what’s common with what’s correct. We take patterns and mistake them for instructions. We see repetition and think: rule. We see deviation and call it sin.

David Hume warned about this centuries ago: just because something is, doesn’t mean it *ought* to be. You can trace the rhythms of the world—you can observe cruelty, hierarchy, survival. But that doesn’t tell you what’s right. It only tells you what’s been.

Humans, historically, have been vicious. We harm. We exclude. We abandon. That doesn’t mean we should.

There’s no shortcut from description to ethics. No clean line from what happens to what’s good.

But still, we reach. Still, we hunger for something settled. Something handed down. Something that doesn’t require constant interpretation. And maybe that’s the deeper truth beneath the word “unnatural.”

It’s not a claim about the world. It’s an anxiety of expanding our own.

But I don’t want to be too quick here. Because I’ve felt it too—the ache for something more grounded. More given. More clear.

The desire to be told what’s real. What’s right. What’s *meant*.

And that’s why I’ve been thinking about cicadas in summer.

### Four: In the Postcards of Maurilia

There’s something so quietly simple about that image.

Nostalgia always feels like it belongs to the natural. Untouched. Unmodified. It’s hard to imagine nostalgia for asphalt, or algorithmic feeds. But we do it. Because even the recent past feels older than it should.

Nostalgia sounds like cicadas in summer. It smells like rain on a subway grate. It hides in the plastic click of an old Nintendo DS loading *Pokémon Diamond*. And even if you weren’t happy then, the memory insists that you were. The memory becomes the proof.

A few years ago, people became obsessed with photos of abandoned malls. Fluorescent lighting. Escalators to nowhere. Carpet too thin to feel. These were called liminal spaces—not homes, not destinations, just transition. People called them eerie, uncanny. But also comforting. Like you could fall asleep inside the in-between. Like something had paused for you.

I think about a story by Italo Calvino, in *Invisible Cities*, about a place called Maurilia. It’s a city filled with postcards of its own past. Tourists are expected to admire the images: the streets narrower, the houses more dignified, the skies more gray. But the trick is: the images aren’t true. They were curated. Stylized. Sold. But the comparison still works. It makes the present feel like a knockoff. A cover version. Too bright, too open, too much.

Calvino writes: “The past is never as it was. It is a picture that must be imagined.”

Still, we believe the picture. We want to. Nostalgia insists that things were once simpler. That people once knew their place. That the world once held together in a way it no longer does.

Even if the past was never like that—and of course, it wasn’t—the emotion still grips us. The ache remains. I don’t want to dismiss it. It’s easy to laugh at retro Instagram filters, grainy mall photos, a longing for a world without push notifications. But those longings are real. The desire for ground. For order. For something that doesn’t change while you’re asleep.

But fear and anxiety don’t belong to the past. They’re forward-looking. They anticipate. They reach ahead. We don’t dread and worry about the past the same way we do about the future.

The Roman philosopher-poet Lucretius once observed something strange. We don’t grieve the time before we were born. We only dread what comes after we die. But they’re too identical voids: we weren’t there before we were born and we won’t be around after we die, either.

Our fear flows only in one direction. It’s like time itself is a one-way mirror. The past, we can romanticize. The future, we brace against.

You see it best when you imagine how future generations might feel nostalgic about right now. Picture a college party in 2054 with a “twenties” theme. What does it look like? White sneakers and Arc'teryx shells? Labubu keychains and oat milk lattes? Maybe someone will show up in dark academia cosplay, quoting TikTok therapy-speak over a jazz remix of Sabrina Carpenter.

But of course, that won’t be all that the 2020s were. Just as the '60s weren’t all peace signs and tie-dye. The aesthetic will survive, but the complexity will go. The anxiety, the precarity, the climate dread, the quiet ache of logging on and pretending to be okay—those parts fade.

Nostalgia trims the fat of feeling. It reduces contradiction into symbol.

That’s the trick of Maurilia. The tourists are shown curated postcards—glimpses of how the city used to be. And they’re told to mourn what was lost. But postcards are made to be sold. They are snapshots meant to represent a whole. They are small, clean, untruthful.

They make the present feel counterfeit. The present always feels counterfeit.

So maybe what we long for isn’t the past at all. Maybe it’s the illusion of coherence that the past seems to offer. We tell ourselves history was resolved. That nature was once in balance. That things made sense. But the future is jagged. Indeterminate. Alive. And that’s terrifying.

So we turn around. We look back. We hold up the postcard. And we convince ourselves that once, at least once, it all fit.

### Five: Saving the Planet

But it’s not just the past we romanticize to soothe ourselves. We do it with language too.

We don’t only reach for old images—we reach for old words. Words like “natural,” “pure,” “real.” Words that offer comfort through their simplicity. But simplicity isn’t the same as clarity. These words function more like handrails in the dark—not because they show us where we’re going, but because they give us something to grip. Even if what they’re holding up is hollow.

Take a phrase like “save the planet.” I used to think it was noble. Still do, in some ways. But I also think about something the comedian George Carlin once said: “Everybody’s going to save something now. Save the trees, save the bees, save the whales, save those snails… The environment’s fine. The people are f*cked.”

It’s a crude joke. But the punchline is gold. The Earth has survived fire and flood, impact and entropy. It has endured worse than us.

What we really mean, when we say “save the planet,” is this: save the version of the planet that lets us live comfortably. Keep the air breathable, the coasts dry, the grain shipments stable.

So when we talk about global warming or rising oceans or biodiversity collapse, we’re not mourning moss or grass. We’re mourning us.

And that’s okay. At least it’s honest. And if anything, the honest truth—our self-interest—demands us to do more.

But I’m interested in how we dress it up. We talk about purity. Balance. Harmony. Sanctity. We act like we’re caretakers of something separate—as if we’re not reshaping it with every breath, every click, every cargo ship.

And this dressing matters. Because the same performance appears elsewhere. In political arguments about what’s “natural.” In cultural panic about family, gender, identity. When people say something is unnatural, they’re not protecting the past. They’re protecting themselves from discomfort. “Unnatural” is a spell we cast to keep the world from changing in ways we haven’t prepared for.

What I can’t stop thinking about isn’t just what we’ve done to the world, but what we’re still doing to the future while pretending we’re protecting it.

We engineer systems that extract, and then paint them green. We glorify nature in principle, while calling drone-planted eucalyptus forests “regenerative.” We strip-mine the Australian outback for lithium while marketing electric cars as clean. We print “natural formula” on labels with ingredients that read like encryption keys. We stage climate protests on devices stitched together from cobalt and vanished groundwater.

You could call it ironic. But irony is too light.

This feels heavier—like watching a species argue with itself in real time. Without resolution. Without clean ground to stand on. Caught between longing and guilt, preservation and power, reverence and ruin.

### Six: The Natural and the Synthetic

</figure>

I’ve been playing fast and loose with the word *nature*. That wasn’t carelessness. It was to show how quickly the word can shapeshift.

We say we are harming *Mother Nature* with our pollution—meaning the biosphere, personified. An older, maternal figure we’ve disrespected.

We say it’s *unnatural* to build highways through rainforests. Or to inject hormones into cows.

We say it’s *natural* to protect our children. To survive. To desire.

We say digging up oil is *unnatural*—until someone says it’s *natural*: human instinct, supply and demand, the pursuit of progress, the exploitation of *natural* resources.

The word moves between meanings without announcing the switch. Sometimes it means the environment. Sometimes instinct. Sometimes morality. Sometimes inevitability. Sometimes original. Sometimes it just means “mine.”

What are we actually saying when we invoke the natural?

Or maybe the better question is: what do we want it to do?

The future asks us to decide what *should* count as natural. Is gene editing unnatural? Is neural enhancement? Is interspecies communication? Is a carbon-neutral megacity? Which kind of forest counts as “real”—the ones bulldozed in Brazil, or the engineered carbon-eating machine at 12x efficiency in a laboratory dome?

Because that’s what we’re doing, isn’t it? Choosing.

“Nature,” in that sense, is synthetic. Not synthetic as in fake, but synthetic as in made. As in shaped. As in chosen. A frame we’ve drawn around a set of meanings we find comforting, or necessary, or useful.

What if we let go of the word entirely?

What would it mean to think not in terms of *natural* and *unnatural*, but simply in terms of the *synthetic*?

And yes—synthetic as in chosen. *Because* it means chosen.

We don’t need ethics for nature. Nature doesn’t ask. Nature doesn’t care. We need ethics for the synthetic—for the things we’ve shaped, and the power we now have to reshape ourselves. We need ways of thinking that can handle contingency, ambiguity, recursive change.

Maybe what we need isn’t better principles. Maybe we need better stories.

A new language for what it means to be artificial and still accountable.

A way to speak about design without pretending it’s destiny.

Or maybe we’re already in that silence—between terms, between maps. Past the edge of every compass we inherited. Maybe all that’s left is to walk forward—half-blind, half-resigned—with language that cracks as we speak it.

But this I know: the words still matter.

And the stories we tell—about what’s natural, what’s sacred, what’s “too much”—will shape the future more than carbon or code.

### Seven: Concrete and Flesh

This summer, the cicadas still haven’t come. Or maybe they have, but I’ve forgotten how to listen for them. The sounds doesn’t pierce through glass anymore—not through the double-paned windows or the white noise of central air.

But I keep looking up at that building. The one with the chrome curve and blue-glass shimmer. It still doesn’t look natural. But it doesn’t look unnatural either.

A structure that looks like a body.

Steel and concrete, engineered to look like flesh and memory.

A city of postcards, each one pretending to show what was.

“Natural” doesn’t mean unmade. It means invisible labor. It means values dressed as facs. It means systems that have existed long enough to stop being questioned.

And so we build skyscrapers that shimmer like trees. We code models that talk like therapists. We feed them our voices and our stories and our longings, and we call them synthetic—as if we weren’t.

As if we weren’t also stitched together from memory, from carbon, from recursion.

As if we didn’t keep trying to grow backwards, even while dreaming forward.
